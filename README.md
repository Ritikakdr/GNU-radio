## GNU radio blocks to Transmit(Modulate) LoRa signals.
## Introduction
GNU Radio provides blocks for LoRa modulation and demodulation, supporting long-range communication in unlicensed bands. Configurable parameters enable tailored LoRa communication for diverse applications, from extended-distance data transmission to low-power sensor reception.
Chirp spread spectrum is a type of spread spectrum modulation where the frequency of the transmitted signal varies continuously over time, LoRa uses this. Usually the spectrum bands are 868MHz,915Mhz,433Mhz.
